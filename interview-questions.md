# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. Tip: providing an example can help communicate your point if you struggle with the vocabulary.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

Your answer: an argument is passed on to the parameter. the parameter is additional information used for a variable.

Researched answer: a parameter is a placeholder variable used inside of the paranthese of a function and an argument is the assigned value of the parameter. the argument goes into the paranthese of the function invocation and must be a data type that javascript recognizes.

2. What is the difference between an object and a class?

Your answer: an object is a way to hold key:values and a class can hold an object in a function, and allows for the function to be reused without changing how the object is being used in said function.

Researched answer: classes are the blueprint of objects. they're a special kind of function that contains data and behavior. and objects are a data type that uses key:value pairs and can be held inside of a class.

3. What is iteration?

Your answer: iteration is something that i'm not yet completely familiar with, but i believe it has to do with classes and using information that tells the computer how to use the information that is inside of the class.

Researched answer: I was actually very wrong, i was thinking of "instantiate". iteration is performing an action until a condition is met and you can do that by using for loops.

4. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

Researched answer: hoisting is the ablity of a function, variable, or class to be used before declaration.
